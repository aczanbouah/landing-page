Landing page project for The Odin Project

This is a landing page for a producer who sells instrumentals (all names in the project are fictional and any resemblance to any real person is purely coincidental). The page is made with HTML and CSS and the elements are arranged with flexbox.

I've altered the color scheme of the original assignment and I've added a Spotify embed to my own music instead of an image in the first container (feel free to check it out!).

The icons in the second container were from <a href="https://icons8.com/">Icons8</a>.
